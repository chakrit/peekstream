# PEEK YOUR STREAMS

PEEKSTREAM is a simple filtering stream that collects and buffers data inside a configured window
as they're being streamed.

Useful for taking a peek at streaming logs or sampling data at intervals.

Also very useful for testing complex stream interactions.

```sh
npm install --save peekstream
```

# API

PeekStream inherits from Stream and supports basic read and write operation.

In addition, PeekStream exports a `window` property that is a `Buffer` of the data that has
been filtered.  When source stream emits `data` the data is appended to the end of the `window`
and any excess from the configured size is trimmed from the beginning of the buffer.

### require('peekstream').peek( SRC, [DEST], [SIZE] )

Creates and return a new PeekStream class instance configured to peek data coming from
`SRC`.

`SRC` stream is automatically piped through the returned PeekStream.

Additionallty, if `DEST` stream is specified, the returned PeekStream will be piped
through the destination stream automatically as well.

### new require('peekstream').PeekStream( [SIZE] )

Creates a `PeekStream` with specified windowing size (defaults to 1 kiB)
